# ldlt-zotero-to-bibl
A repository for transforming a Zotero library exported in TEI format to the format required for the LDLT.

Zotero exports libraries using `biblStruct` tag. The Library of Digital Latin Texts uses `bibl`, so this XSLT is meant to help convert an author's bibliography to the desired format. 

This is a work in progress. Future improvements include a routine to handle multiple authors better. There are also many opportunities for removing redundancies.
